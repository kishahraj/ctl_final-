-	In the project Pitch I identified the problem to solve. – immigration briefs are tedious to create at first and automation would make it easier. 

a.	Brainstorm Mission/Goal statement for project: 
•	"To help Immigration Clinic Students write legal briefs efficiently" 
•	"To act as a secondary source of legal citation for Immigration Clinic Students interested in    an LGBTQ Asylum: Well-Founded Fear claim"
•	"To act as an example of what a legal brief should look like" 
•	“Use docassemble to automate an LGBTQ asylum brief” [Ultimately this was what was on the Project Pitch slide]
      
    At our meeting on October 1, 2019 Ragini suggested that the brief could also be used by organizations like Al Otra Lado who are fighting for immigrant rights at the border and need more brief samples. Visit their website here: https://alotrolado.org/who-we-are/. At first she was unsure if Al Otro Lado would also be users but she confirmed at the end of November that she would like to give Al Otro Lado access to this bot if Professor Colarusso gives the green light for the project’s application and use. Therefore, I had to modify my goal statement. 

b.	Modified Brainstorm of Mission/Goal statement based on new potential users
•	“To help Immigration practitioners and para-professionals access and cite to existing LGBTQ asylum cases in their brief writing” 
•	“Streamlining the brief writing process for immigration practitioners and para-professionals by using a document automation bot to create an LGBTQ asylum brief with their clients information” 

FINAL GOAL: “A document automation bot that allows Immigration Clinic Students and Immigration Law Practitioners to create a LGBTQ asylum brief more efficiently” 

User personas to test – Immigration Clinic Students, My roommate who is now a phd student but worked with immigration law nonprofit in her undergrad, an attorney from De Novo – Lisa Weinberg

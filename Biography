          -In the project Pitch I identified the problem to solve. – immigration briefs are tedious to create at first and automation would make it easier. 

      a.	Brainstorm Mission/Goal statement for project: 
	      -"To help Immigration Clinic Students write legal briefs efficiently" 
	      -"To act as a secondary source of legal citation for Immigration Clinic Students interested in    an LGBTQ Asylum: Well-Founded Fear claim"
	      -"To act as an example of what a legal brief should look like" 
	      -“Use docassemble to automate an LGBTQ asylum brief” [Ultimately this was what was on the Project Pitch slide]
      
           At our meeting on October 1, 2019 Ragini suggested that the brief could also be used by organizations like Al Otra Lado who are fighting for immigrant rights at the border and need more brief samples. Visit their website here: https://alotrolado.org/who-we-are/. At first she was unsure if Al Otro Lado would also be users but she confirmed at the end of November that she would like to give Al Otro Lado access to this bot if Professor Colarusso gives the green light for the project’s application and use. Therefore, I had to modify my goal statement. 

      b.	Modified Brainstorm of Mission/Goal statement based on new potential users
	      -“To help Immigration practitioners and para-professionals access and cite to existing LGBTQ asylum cases in their brief writing” 
	      -“Streamlining the brief writing process for immigration practitioners and para-professionals by using a document automation bot to create an LGBTQ asylum brief with their clients information” 

      FINAL GOAL: “A document automation bot that allows Immigration Clinic Students and Immigration Law Practitioners to create a LGBTQ asylum brief more efficiently” 

      User personas to test – Immigration Clinic Students, My roommate who is now a phd student but worked with immigration law nonprofit in her undergrad, an attorney from De Novo – Lisa Weinberg 
      
2. Research 

      Existing Solutions or Lack of 
      
      - The Catholic Legal Immigration (a non-profit) has sample appellate brief samples up but there are none for asylum claims when they start out. This would be beneficial because a good legal brief 
      brief would help so that the case does not go to the appellate level. 
      - Clinic students have PDF versions of past briefs but can't edit those easily and can't customize the headings/formatting 
      - https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2019/07/16/bloomberg-law-teases-automated-brief-analyzer-in-beta-this-fall/?slreturn=20191116150653
            Bloomberg Law is creating a brief analyzer but there haven't been a successful inclusion of bot generated briefs in any type of law per my research 
            Why is this? 
                  Cons: -Can't customize because clients have multiple unique details and circumstances that can't be captured with a non customizable brief generated by a bot 
                        -concerns about the client information being uploaded 
      
      -Definition of Refugee: INA 101(a)(42)(A) The term "refugee" means any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion
      -Here, we are only focusing on particular social group asylum claims which is one of the reasons someone can be persecuted for. Specifically ones were the particular social group involves a sexual orientation 
      - Need the following sections in the brief 
            A. Meet Refugee Definition 
            B. Timely Filing of Application 
            C. Well Founded Fear of Persecution 
                  1. Well Founded Fear Description
                        a. Objectively Reasonable 
                        b. Subjectively Reasonable 
                        c. Fear is country-wide 
                  2. Particular Social Group 
                        a. Immutable 
                        b. Socially Distinct 
                        c. Particular 
                  3. Nexus (harm will be because of membership in particular social group) 
                  4. Government unwilling and unable to protect 
            D. Discretion Factors 
            
      Consultation with Practictioners 
      
            - Spoke to Ragini in early November: There aren't any brief automation tools that exist. Practictioners usually share briefs via email but there is not a template that people can universally use 
            - Spoke to Lisa from De Novo at the MLRI meeting that I went to for the LIT project but I asked her about this as well: She also agreed that there was not a tool similar to this and said that she would find the idea 
            useful for her interns or students who need to learn how to write a brief for immigration law. She said the same as Ragini that now briefs are shared via email but there is not a way to streamline the process of 
            creating a brief. She said formatting the brief is difficult because of the definition of a refugee and the different elements that need to be proved. 
     

3. Ideation & Prototyping 

      Considers and weighs the costs & benefits of multiple techinical solutions 
            - Brief Automation Tool 
                  Pros: 1.Secondary source for well-founded fear claim 2.Efficient way to start a brief 3.Formatting is easier 4.Took me 6 hours to finish a first draft but most of that was done with the bot because my final brief was 12 pages this is 9 pages.  
                  Cons: 1.Client information storage 2.Is it truly customizable? 3. Afterwards someone needs to keep track of asylum law changes 
      Creates prototyping only after considering at least three alternatives
      	    - Could just have a template that has blanks that people can manually input on word 
	    - Create a PDF with fillable blanks - however this would make it difficult to change the rest of the document 
	    - Downloadable Word document with full redacted brief that someone could edit - but how would you get this to the people? Not as easy as an automated bot
	    
        An automated bot not only gives people a word document but one that pertains to them and is formatted the way a brief should be. 
      
4. User Testing 
      Users tested: Two clinic students, Lisa from De Novo, and my roommate took the google form after using the bot and provided feedback. 
      Initial Feedback Recorded here cause I didn't initially have a google form but then had them look at the final version on December 16 with a google form
      	Feedback on November 12, 2019 - Roommate who used to work for Immigration Non-Profit 
		- "I'm confused as to what the bot is about. Maybe put a clearer title"
		- "I do like that it gives me a document that I can download"
		- "The dates need to be changed as well" 
		- Suggestions and Conclusion from her: "I like the idea but I think it needs to have more questions and be more customizable. 
	Feedback on November 13, 2019 - Two Immigration Clinic Students took it on my laptop on vdi and filled out their client info. 
		- "this was helpful as a secondary resource of LGBTQ asylum law" 
		- "It would decrease time taken on writing the first draft of briefs" 
		- "I like this idea especially since all the cases this semester were LGBTQ based asylum cases" 
		- "Maybe have a disclaimer on there about the fact that you can't be responsible for updating the legal information/citations" 
		- "Split up the client name since sometimes we use only their first name. We don't use the full name all throughout the brief"
		- "Very helpful idea, we can't wait to test it out later"
		
      Sent a google Form to Roommate, Clinic Students and Lisa from De Novo about the final version - all got back to me the same day 
      		Questionairre Results Round Two: https://github.com/kishahraj/ctl_final-/blob/master/Brief%20Automation%20Questionnaire%20.csv
5. Refinement 

      After Round 1 Feedback 
      	- Added the date as a variable. 
	- Added a disclaimer and described the goals of the project and what users should expect 
	- Include in the disclaimer that they should cite check 
	- Added variables Client First Name, Client Last Name 
      
      After Round 2 Feedback 
      	- Added more variables that were suggested in round two of feedback: Particular social group, pronoun etc.  
      	- Analyzed a current LGBTQ asylum brief: Counted the occurrences of finalized variables after Round two of user feedback 
     	- https://github.com/kishahraj/ctl_final-/blob/master/Variable%20Frequency.png
     	- as a result of the above I changed the order of the questioning and because people were concerned about client information I added that they can put in whatever information they feel comfortable
	including as a disclaimer. Therefore, they can input initials of client and go back and change it later. Whatever is comfortable for them.

7. Complexity/Robustness 
	- I used the skills learned in class specifically the document automation. Initially I looked at docassemble but docassemble seemed to be too complicated for the project. I wanted to start with at least a viable product first to beta test
	and that's why I went with QNA markup after I presented to the class in November. I also did look at the frequency of the variables and determined the order of questions based on that. 

8. Impact & Efficiencies 
	- It took me 6 hours to write my first draft of of the legal brief that I used as a sample and that resulted in 12 pages of information. This bot took me 10 minutes to fill out and I had 9 pages of the brief. All people need to add 
	is more client information and country condition research specific to their client to complete the brief. 
	- It took me 6 hours for my legal brief in September even with a sample but I couldn't fill in that sample like I could here
	- It includes the formatting needed so no time wasted in pesky copy and pasting from other briefs and dealing with formatting issues

	- Users all said that this was a good idea and the second round of feedback was more specific changes I had to make and minor changes like variables to add. 
	- A user even said this would have been beneficial to have in the beginning of the semester for the legal brief 
10. Documentation 
	- All documentation is uploaded to the github here: https://github.com/kishahraj/ctl_final-
	- The QNA markup is saved as a text file and html at the above link 
11. Real World Viability 
	- I think before Real World Use I would want to flesh out the disclaimer more and double check with Ragini about the client information issues 
	- As of 1:49 pm on December 17, 2019 I was not able to figure out why the document was not downloading automatically like it was before
	and I slack messaged Professor Colarusso about the problem. If the problem isn't fixed I would say the project needs two more days of work to be complete. 
	- If the project problem does get fixed I think the project would need minimal tweaks to be viable. 
12. Sustainability 
	- I plan on giving the link to Ragini if Professor Colarusso thinks it is ready to use. I have already discussed this with Ragini. I discussed it with her
	on December 11
	- Ragini will be emailing you about her satisfaction with the project. I sent her a reminder on December 17 at 1:00pm. She responded soon after and said she has another 
	deadline that she is working on but can email Professor Colarusso by the end of the day on  December 18.
